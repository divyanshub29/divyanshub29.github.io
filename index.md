Hi, I’m Divyanshu. I live in India and work as a software engineer. I’m interested in problem solving, developer productivity, databases, and distributed systems. I started this blog in 2023.

You can email me if you have questions or thoughts about anything I’ve written. I’d love to hear from you!
